Our project which is now an almost working prototype does a simple but very useful task. The application allows you to build mind maps that have URLs in them. These maps are published to the web. Users must have a delicious account. The application finds delicious users that have many bookmarks in common with the user. The application then recommends bookmarks that are found in the delicious accounts of users with a great number of bookmarks in common with the user. The application also recommends other users mind maps that contain the same URLs. The user is then presented with recommend mind maps and bookmarks which can be merged with the users mind maps to suggest additions to the users maps. All maps are stored in semantic web formats like RDF allowing for the user to easily create semantic web content while brainstorming. We consider this to be a form of auto completion for mind maps.
